# What's new?

## Some general notes

In the second edition we extensively use PyMC and ArviZ. In this new edition we add 3 new libraries to me mix:

* PreliZ a library for prior elicitation
* Bambi a library for Bayesian regression
* Kulrprit a library for variable selection


## Chapter 1

* New introduction to probability theory. The introduction is not meant to be a replacement for a proper course in probability theory, but it should be enough to get you started.


## Chapter 2

* We discuss the Savage-Dickey density ratio (also in chapter 5).
