## Inference Engines {#chp-inference-engines}

<!-- PyMC's base code is written using Python, and the computationally demanding parts are written using NumPy and PyTensor.
PyTensor is a Python library that was originally developed for deep learning and allows us
to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multidimensional
arrays efficiently. The main reason PyMC3 uses Theano is because some of the sampling
methods, such as NUTS, need gradients to be computed, and Theano knows how to
compute gradients using what is known as automatic differentiation. Also, Theano
compiles Python code to C code, and hence PyMC3 is really fast. This is all the information
about Theano we need to have to use PyMC3. If you still want to learn more about it, start
reading the official Theano tutorial
at http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/index.html#tutorial.
You may have heard that Theano is no longer developed, but that's no
reason to worry. PyMC devs will take over Theano maintenance, ensuring
that Theano will keep serving PyMC3 for several years to come. At the
same time, PyMC devs are moving quickly to create the successor to
PyMC3. This will probably be based on TensorFlow as a backend,
although other options are being analyzed as well. You can read more
